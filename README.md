# asteroids
This is my attempt to learn python that was heavily influenced by my dad and
my uncle. Pull requests are welcome as long as you explain to me why the
change is better. Currently, there is unused code from some changes that no-one
remembers how to finish, so you can remove any code relating to making a menu.

Planned changes:
S as reverse thrust
E or similar as bombs
Shift as sheild
fix dirtyCollDetect for bombs (currently they have the incorrect radius).
